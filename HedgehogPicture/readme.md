# Welcome to HedgehogPicture!
### This application allows you to browse and view images from the network based on your search query. It leverages the SerpApi service to fetch and display image results using a simple and intuitive user interface.

Features:

* Search for images based on your query
* Paginated results to easily browse through a large number of images
* Image details view to open an image in a full size, read the description and open a link to the web-site with Safari Web-view.

My app is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface to provide a seamless experience. I'm hope you enjoy using this app to discover and explore the vast world of images available on the internet. Future improvements are coming.


MVVM pattern was used.

#### Make sure to set the correct API key in the ApiKey struct after installation.
